# Brain Tumor Classification with CNN

This project uses a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with **PyTorch** to classify brain MRI images into one of three tumor types:
- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary

The dataset is preprocessed into a `.pickle` file, while the raw images are stored separately. The model is trained on 80% of the data and evaluated on the remaining 20%, achieving high accuracy on unseen images.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Custom CNN Architecture:** Built with 3 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers.
- **RGB Image Processing:** Utilizes torchvision transforms for resizing, normalizing, and converting images to tensors.
- **Dataset Management:** Uses a pickle file to store filename-label tuples with raw images kept in a separate directory.
- **Robust Evaluation:** Implements an 80/20 train-test split using PyTorchâ€™s `random_split`.
- **Modular Design:** All code is organized under the `src/` directory.
- **Future Extension:** Plans to build a web application (using Flask or FastAPI) to allow users to upload images and display predictions in real time.
