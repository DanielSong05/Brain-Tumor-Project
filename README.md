# Brain Tumor Classification with CNN

This project uses a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with **PyTorch** to classify brain MRI images into one of three tumor types:
- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary

The dataset is preprocessed into a `.pickle` file, while the raw images are stored separately. The model is trained on 80% of the data and evaluated on the remaining 20%, achieving high accuracy on unseen images.
